Coding Challenge

Database uses postgres, defaults to user:postgres pass:password, this can be changed in the application.properties.
Flyway is used to set up the tables / starting data, no further configuration required.
Maven is used, run mvn clean install to insure all dependencies are available.
I used postman to make my calls, example calls are as follows:

POST http://localhost:8080/addDataPoint
BODY 
{
    "sensorId":1,

    "temperature":15,

    "humidity":15,

    "windSpeed":105.2,

    "date":"2023-12-17T17:08:06.192+00:00"
}
* all fields required for create DataPoint call


GET http://localhost:8080/query
BODY
{
    "sensorSelection":"ALL",
    "fieldsSelection":"ALL",
    "statisticType":"MIN",
    "sensorIds": [1],
    "fields": ["humidity", "windSpeed"],
    "dateRangeDTO": {
        "startDate":"2022-12-17T17:08:06.192+00:00",
        "endDate":"2023-12-15T17:08:06.192+00:00"
    }
}
* statisticType is always required for query call, options are MIN MAX AVG SUM
* sensorIds and fields must be provided unless sensorSelection/fieldsSelection are set to ALL
